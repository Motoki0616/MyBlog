# Wordpress Theme
Simple Wordpress Theme for my blog : http://countryside-webdeveloper.com.  
My blog is named “Super Countryside Developer” since I grew up in the countryside of Japan.  
My blog documents my web development and design journey to readers. 

## Design Concept
This is a blog site so I wanted readers to foucs on my article contents. I removed unnecessary things as possible as I can and make white space around the contents.  
I used Sherwood Green(#0F4C3A) as a key color, Catskill White(#E6EBE1) as a background color.  
I wanted to express Countryside atmosphere as the blog name using the colors.

## Code architecture for CSS
* BEM (http://getbem.com/naming)
* SMACSS (https://smacss.com)

### BEM
The Block, Element, Modifier methodology (commonly referred to as BEM) is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS.
* When we want to make a new style of a component, we can easily see which modifiers and children already exist.
* When we are reading the markup instead of CSS, we can quickly get an idea of which element depends on another.
* Designers and developers can consistently name components for easier communication between team members.

### SMACSS
SMACSS stands for Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS.
* Ease of demonstration and handover
* Ease of reading
* Scalable for all projects
